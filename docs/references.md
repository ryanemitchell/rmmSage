## Dev Envrionment notes

WP CLI required and I recommend a global install on your development machine - https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/

WP CLI in Local - https://salferrarello.com/wp-cli-local-by-flywheel-without-ssh/#quick-setup

In local root (where app, conf and logs directory are.)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salcode/wpcli-localwp-setup/main/wpcli-localwp-setup  && bash wpcli-localwp-setup && rm -rf ./wpcli-localwp-setup
